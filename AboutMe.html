                <p class="iCantNameThings">I don't really have that much to say about myself, I am a student, with around ~3 years of translating experience, and ~1-2 years of programming expererience.
                  I spend most of my free time nowadays studying things like Calc 3 and General Relativity, i have recently picked up Quantum Mechanics, but it seems way too complex for me.

       <div class="content">
        <p class="iCantNameThings2">As a highly ambitious student, I am deeply devoted to unraveling the enigmatic complexities of the cosmos. There is nothing quite as captivating as delving into the origins and transformations of stars and galaxies, as well as investigating the behaviors of celestial bodies. My insatiable thirst for knowledge and curiosity has driven me to pursue a degree in astrophysics, and I am already making remarkable progress in my academic career. <br>

          One of the formulas that fascinates me most in this field is "r = 2GM/c^2", which describes the Schwarzschild radius of a non-rotating black hole. In essence, it represents the distance from the center of a black hole where the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, leading to the formation of the event horizon. This formula provides a glimpse into the incredible forces at play within these mysterious objects. <br>
          
          Another formula that has captured my attention is "4p + 2n → 4He + energy", which describes the process of nuclear fusion that powers stars. This equation represents the fusion of four protons and two neutrons to form helium and energy, which is the source of the radiant energy emitted by stars. The intricacy of this process highlights the wondrous mechanisms that underlie the life cycle of stars. <br>
          
          As a well-rounded individual, I also indulge in a diverse range of hobbies and interests. Among them, I take great pleasure in the intellectual challenge of the game of chess, which requires strategic thinking and meticulous planning. It provides a much-needed reprieve after long days of studying and programming. Speaking of programming, I am a seasoned web developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and PHP. My proficiency in creating visually appealing and functional websites and web applications is matched only by my passion for the design and coding process. I take great pride in delivering high-quality work that meets my clients' needs, from personal blogs to sophisticated e-commerce sites. <br>
          
          In addition, I have taken on the role of a translator for some of the most prominent games on the online gaming platform, Roblox. Utilizing my language skills, I help make these games more inclusive and accessible to players from around the world, actively contributing to a community that values diversity and unity. My passion for astrophysics, programming, and language is boundless, and I am eager to explore where these passions will take me in the future. Whether it is investigating the mysteries of the universe, developing innovative web applications, or bridging linguistic divides on Roblox, I am confident that I will continue to make a positive impact on the world. <br>
          
          Furthermore, another fascinating formula that has captured my attention is "Ψ(r,θ,φ,t) = ∑l,m,n [Almn Rnl(r) Ylm(θ,φ) e^(-iωt)]". This formula represents the wave function in quantum mechanics, describing the probability of finding a particle in a particular state. It utilizes spherical harmonics, which provide a mathematical representation of the spherical symmetry in quantum mechanics. The complexity of this formula highlights the intricate and fascinating nature of the quantum world. <br> 
          As a multifaceted individual, I possess a deep passion for the art of music, and the synthesizer is a medium through which I express my creative impulses. In particular, my proficiency in playing songs from the illustrious Balkan singers Sinan Sakic, Saban Saulic, and Mile Kitic is a testament to my versatility as a musician.

My love for music began at a young age, as I was enamored by the sounds that surrounded me. Growing up in a culturally diverse community, I was exposed to a variety of musical genres, but it was the harmonious tones of Balkan music that truly captivated me. The rhythms and melodies of Sinan Sakic, Saban Saulic, and Mile Kitic spoke to my soul, and I was determined to master the synthesizer in order to recreate these iconic songs. <br>

Through countless hours of practice and dedication, I have honed my skills on the synthesizer, and I can now seamlessly perform songs from these legendary artists. The intricate nuances of each melody and rhythm require a keen ear and a precise touch, and I have worked tirelessly to achieve the level of proficiency that I now possess. <br>

What sets my playing apart is not only my technical ability but also my emotional connection to the music. The soulful lyrics and evocative harmonies of Balkan music have a profound impact on me, and I channel this emotion into my performances. Whether I am playing the haunting melodies of Sinan Sakic's "Ostani" or the upbeat rhythms of Saban Saulic's "Ljubav Je Kao Violina," I strive to convey the essence of the music to my audience. <br>
